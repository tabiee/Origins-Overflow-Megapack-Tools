	"description": "Through the faint wisps of memory, there stands alone a single creature. Destined to pave the way through unfamiliar powers without the aid of their kind. As a Tanuki you had the ability to shapeshift into anything you could think about. But after an uncertain exile, you now only have a few different forms you can change between, each with its own abilities. While you may not be a full creature of mischief, it still runs deep through your body."
