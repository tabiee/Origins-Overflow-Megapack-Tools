# Origins-Overflow-Megapack-Tools
Everything I use and create for the Origins mod.

Feel free to grab things from here to create something of your own, just remember to link back to these files to allow others to use them as well!

## Hello! My name is Tabee!
### Thanks for checking out my bundle of origins!
---
#### I have also created Weeping Angel and Celestial Duo origins (and it's models). The files for them are either here or on a separate post on the Origins discord in #datapacks.
#### You can find the models and instructions on how to install/use them on my [PlanetMinecraft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/fnaf-sb-sun-amp-moon-accessories/) post for them.

# Concerning this megapack:

> ### **How are there so many datapacks? Did you make all of these? How many are there?**
- There are approximately 100+ origins in total.
- They are all made by me 
   - If you find someone else's work, let me know, I'll delete/credit them. I can't remember what is where unfortunately (GitHub version ignores this for now)
- 99% of these datapacks were commissioned on Fiverr by over 50 people.

> ### **What? Fiverr? Can you make me an origin too?**
- My Fiverr is [Meightaboot](https://www.fiverr.com/meightaboot), although I am currently NOT active.
   - I plan to (maybe) return to origins creation in summer, or whenever 1.20 comes out.
   - No promises, it depends on my interest and availability
   - I am currently studying in uni for Game Development and I might focus on Unity instead of Origins :)
- If you want to commission me, sorry not now! Please don't message me about it on Discord.
- If you commissioned me before and can see your datapack here, you may request that I remove it if you'd rather not have it shared.

> ### **There's something wrong with one of the datapacks, can you fix it?**
- If you found a bug, no you didn't. I will not be updating anything except Weeping Angel and Celestial Duo.
- If a datapack requires another mod but doesn't state that it does, let me know.

> ### **Who are you and where did you even come from?**
- I am a lurker in the Origins discord server. Oops :p
   - I'm too tired most of the time to be active in any discord server, or anywhere on social media really.
   - I just made a bunch of origins because they were fun, and I'm not even good at vanilla datapacks lmao
   - Frankly, I've been waiting too long to upload this stuff, I put it off for like half a year.
- You can share my [GitHub](https://github.com/tabiee/Origins-Overflow-Megapack-Tools) page, this will have the unedited version of the Overflow megapack 
   - That one I use actively, it includes all of my template powers and additional resources I use for datapack creation
   - Feel free to grab things from there to make origins of your own!
   - Do credit me by dropping a link to the GitHub so that more people can use my tools! I'd love to encourage creativity!
- You might also have access to the game demos me and my group at uni have been making?
   - Not entirely sure how GitHub works yet but hey if you are a programmer you can come and laugh at my terrible code.
   
   # Have fun!
